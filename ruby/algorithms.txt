Release 1 - Real Life Algorithm

Clean/Wash the glass on the patio door

Assumptions:
Tools
  Bucket - hot water with window cleaner
  Sponge = 5" x 6"

Begin at top left corner of glass
Until the entire door glass has been washed - until the bottom of the glass, opposite of the top, bottom right, opposite of begin point of rectangle, has been reached.

  Saturate sponge in bucket
  Press sponge to glass at begin point
    While continuing to press sponge against the glass
      Slide/Move sponge to the right along the glass in a straight line
        until the edge of the glass is reached
      stop
      Slide/Move sponge to the left along the glass in a straight line
        until the edge of the glass is reached
      stop
    While continuing to press sponge against the glass
      Slide/Move sponge down 6 inches
      stop
      Slide/Move sponge to the right along the glass in a straight line
        until the edge of the glass is reached
      stop
      Slide/move sponge to the left along the glass in a straight line
        until the edge of the glass is reached
      stop
    Identify this stop point as L2
    Wring out sponge in bucket
  Press sponge to glass at L2 position
  Slide/Move sponge down 6 inches
    While continuing to press sponge against the glass
      Slide/Move sponge to the right along the glass in a straight line
        until the edge of the glass is reached
      stop
      Slide/Move sponge to the left along the glass in a straight line
        until the edge of the glass is reached
      stop
    While continuing to press sponge against the glass
      Slide/Move sponge down 6 inches
      stop
      Slide/Move sponge to the right along the glass in a straight line
        until the edge of the glass is reached
      stop
      Slide/move sponge to the left along the glass in a straight line
        until the edge of the glass is reached
      stop
      Identify this stop point as L4 (L2 + 2)
    Wring out sponge in bucket
  Press sponge to glass at L4 position
  Slide/Move sponge down 6 inches

  Continue washing until bottom right corner is reached

  End washing window
