Data Structures
1. Why are data structures useful in programming?

They are holders of smaller pieces of data. They help organize the data and improve control flow.

Arrays
2. Define "array" and describe the characteristics of an array.
container of lists, can contain any data type

3. Give two original examples of data sets that an array might be well-suited for.
most types of lists of any kind, flat lists, to do lists, inventory lists

Hashes
4. Define "hash" and describe the characteristics of a hash.
container that stores things and multiple different kinds of things in pairs, an identifier that has a name and a value (key / value pairs)

5. Give two original examples of data sets that a hash might be well-suited for.
cars - make & model
tools - type & kind of work used for (ie; plumbing)


Iteration
6. Why is iteration useful?
to improve efficiency of program code as well as make it more readable

7. Give an example of a real-life task that would require iteration if you wrote an algorithm for it.
washing a window, going back and forth and turning to go to the next row or column to clean


Blocks
8. What is a block?
used with iteration, a sub or mini routine performed on data within the block and has its own methods


9. What is a block parameter, and where does its value come from
the name is anything we name it but the value is determined by what method is being called
